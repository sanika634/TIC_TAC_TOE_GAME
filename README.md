# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

A classic, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with **Python**, featuring a clean command-line interface (or GUI, depending on your implementation). This project demonstrates the implementation of game logic, turn-based mechanics, and win-condition algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- **Two-Player Mode:** Play against a friend locally.
- **Dynamic Board:** Real-time updates of the 3x3 grid.
- **Smart Validation:** Prevents players from choosing occupied spots or invalid inputs.
- **Win Detection:** Automatically detects horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins, as well as draws.
- **Clean UI:** Easy-to-read console output.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts:** Functions, Loops, Conditional Logic, and List Manipulation.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone [https://github.com/sanika634/TIC_TAC_TOE_GAME.git](https://github.com/sanika634/TIC_TAC_TOE_GAME.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash
cd TIC_TAC_TOE_GAME
Run the Game:

🎮 How to Play
The game starts with a blank 3x3 grid.

Players are assigned symbols: Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).

Enter the position (1-9) where you want to place your mark.

The first player to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins!

If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
